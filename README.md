## Introduction

PHP's [var_export()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-export.php) function is a handy way to export a variable as executable PHP code.
 
It is particularly useful to store data that can be cached by OPCache, and later retrieved very fast, much faster than unserializing data using `unserialize()` or `json_decode()`.

It also suffers from several drawbacks:

- It outputs arrays as `array()` notation, instead of the short `[]` notation
- It outputs numeric arrays with explicit and unnecessary `0 => ...` key => value syntax
- It outputs invalid PHP code for `stdClass` objects, using `stdClass::__set_state()` which doesn't exist
- It cannot handle objects with public properties, without implementing `__set_state()` explicitly
- `__set_state()` does not play well with private properties in parent classes, which make the implementation tedious
- `var_export()` does not complain when exporting an object with overridden private properties, and outputs and array with duplicate keys

This library aims to provide a prettier, safer, and powerful alternative to `var_export()`.

### Installation

This library is installable via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require brick/varexporter
```

### Requirements

This library requires PHP 7.1 or later.

### Project status & release process

While this library is still under development, it is well tested and should be stable enough to use in production environments.

The current releases are numbered `0.x.y`. When a non-breaking change is introduced (adding new methods, optimizing existing code, etc.), `y` is incremented.

**When a breaking change is introduced, a new `0.x` version cycle is always started.**

It is therefore safe to lock your project to a given release cycle, such as `0.1.*`.

If you need to upgrade to a newer release cycle, check the [release history](https://github.com/brick/varexporter/releases) for a list of changes introduced by each further `0.x.0` version.

## Quickstart

This library offers a single method, `VarExporter::export()` which works pretty much like `var_export()`:

```php
use Brick\VarExporter\VarExporter;

echo VarExporter::export([1, 2, ['foo' => 'bar', 'baz' => []]]);
```

This code will output:

```php
[
    1,
    2,
    [
        'foo' => 'bar',
        'baz' => []
    ]
]
```

Compare this to the `var_export` output:

```php
array (
  0 => 1,
  1 => 2,
  2 => 
  array (
    'foo' => 'bar',
    'baz' => 
    array (
    ),
  ),
)
```

Note: unlike `var_export()`, `export()` always returns the exported variable, and never outputs it.

## Exporting stdClass objects

You come across a `stdClass` object every time you cast an array to an object, or use `json_decode()` with the second argument set to `false` (which is the default).

While the output of `var_export()` for `stdClass` is syntactically valid PHP code:

```php
var_export(json_decode('
    {
        "foo": "bar",
        "baz": {
            "hello": "world"
        }
    }
'));
```

```php
stdClass::__set_state(array(
   'foo' => 'bar',
   'baz' => 
  stdClass::__set_state(array(
     'hello' => 'world',
  )),
))
```

it is totally useless as it assumes that `stdClass` has a static `__set_state()` method, when it doesn't:

> Error: Call to undefined method stdClass::__set_state()

### What does `VarExporter` do instead?

It outputs an array to object cast, which is syntactically valid, readable **and** executable:

```php
echo VarExporter::export(json_decode('
    {
        "foo": "bar",
        "baz": {
            "hello": "world"
        }
    }
'));
```

```php
(object) [
    'foo' => 'bar',
    'baz' => (object) [
        'hello' => 'world'
    ]
]
```

## Exporting custom objects

As we've seen above, `var_export()` assumes that every object has a static [__set_state()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#object.set-state) method that takes an associative array of property names to values, and returns a object.

This means that if you want to export an instance of a class outside of your control, you're screwed up. This also means that you have to write boilerplate code for your classes, that looks like:

```php
class Foo
{
    public $a;
    public $b;
    public $c;

    public static function __set_state(array $array) : self
    {
        $object = new self;

        $object->a = $array['a'];
        $object->b = $array['b'];
        $object->c = $array['c'];

        return $object;
    }
}
```

Or the more dynamic, reusable, and less IDE-friendly version:

```php
public static function __set_state(array $array) : self
{
    $object = new self;

    foreach ($array as $key => $value) {
        $object->{$key} = $value;
    }

    return $object;
}
```

If your class has a parent with private properties, you may have to do some gymnastics to write the value, and if your class overrides a private property of its parent, you're out of luck as `var_export()` puts all properties in the same bag, outputting an array with a duplicate key.

### What does `VarExporter` do instead?

If performs several checks to find the most appropriate export method, in this order:

- If your custom class has a `__set_state()` method, `VarExporter` uses it just like `var_export()` would do:

    ```php
    \My\CustomClass::__set_state([
        'foo' => 'Hello',
        'bar' => 'World'
    ])
    ```

    The array passed to `__set_state()` will be built with the same semantics used by `var_export()`; this library aims to be 100% compatible in this regard. The only difference is when your class has overridden private properties: `var_export()` will output an array that contains the same key twice, while `VarExporter` will throw an `ExportException` to keep you on the safe side.

- If your class has `__serialize()` and `__unserialize()` methods ([introduced in PHP 7.4](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/custom_object_serialization), but this library accepts them in previous versions of PHP!), `VarExporter` will use the output of `__serialize()` to export the object, which will be given as input to `__unserialize()` to reconstruct the object:

    ```php
    (static function() {
        $class = new \ReflectionClass(\My\CustomClass::class);
        $object = $class->newInstanceWithoutConstructor();
    
        $object->__unserialize([
            'foo' => 'Test',
            'bar' => 1234
        ]);
    
        return $object;
    })()
    ```

    This method is the recommended method for exporting complex custom objects: it is forward compatible with the new serialization mechanism introduced in PHP 7.4, flexible, safe, and composes very well under inheritance.

- If the class has only public properties, and no constructor, `VarExporter` produces an output similar to:

    ```php
    (static function() {
        $object = new \My\CustomClass;
        $object->foo = 'Hello';
        $object->bar = 'World';
    
        return $object;
    })()
    ```

- Finally, if the class does not meet any of the conditions above, it can be exported using reflection, which looks like:

    ```php
    (static function() {
        $class = new \ReflectionClass(\My\CustomClass::class);
        $object = $class->newInstanceWithoutConstructor();

        $object->publicProp = 'Hello';

        $property = $class->getProperty('protectedProp');
        $property->setAccessible(true);
        $property->setValue($object, 'protected prop contents');

        $property = new \ReflectionProperty(\My\ParentClass::class, 'privatePropInParent');
        $property->setAccessible(true);
        $property->setValue($object, 'private prop contents');

        return $object;
    })()
    ```

    The reflection method is very powerful: it can export any custom class, with `private`/`protected`/`public` properties, constructors, and even dynamic properties and overridden private properties.

    At the same time, this method is quickly verbose in output, slower (reflection comes at a cost), and fragile: any change to the class being exported may require a new export of its instances, as the reflection code could be out of date.

    For this reason, **exporting using reflection is disabled by default**, and you'll get an `ExportException` if `export()` has to fall back to using reflection. To explicitly enable it, use the [`ALLOW_REFLECTION`](#varexporterallow_reflection) option.

## Options

`VarExporter::export()` accepts a bitmask of options as a second parameter. Here are the available options:

### `VarExporter::ADD_RETURN`

Wraps the output in a return statement:

```php
return (...);
```

This makes the code ready to be executed in a PHP fileâ€•or eval(), for that matter.

### `VarExporter::ALLOW_REFLECTION`

Allows classes with a constructor or non-public properties to be exported using reflection.

By default, `export()` will refuse to handle such objects and throw an exception. Set this flag to allow it.

*Note that even when this flag is not set, reflection may still be used to create an empty shell for
`__unserialize()`.*

### `VarExporter::SKIP_DYNAMIC_PROPERTIES`

Skips dynamic properties on custom classes in the output. By default, any dynamic property set on a custom class is
exported; if this flag is set, dynamic properties are only allowed on stdClass objects, and ignored on other objects.

## Error handling

Any error occurring on `export()` will throw an `ExportException`:

```php
use Brick\VarExporter\VarExporter;
use Brick\VarExporter\ExportException;

try {
    VarExporter::export(fopen('php://memory', 'r'));
} catch (ExportException $e) {
    // Type "resource" is not supported.
}
```

## Limitations

- Exporting internal classes, including closures, is currently not supported. `VarExporter` will throw an `ExportException` if it finds one.

  To handle these, you can implement `__serialize()` and `__unserialize()` in classes that contain references to internal objects.

- Just like `var_export()`, `VarExporter` cannot currently maintain object identity (two instances of the same object, once exported, will create 2 identical (`==`) yet distinct (`!==`) objects).

- And just like `var_export()`, it cannot currently handle circular references, such as object `A` pointing to `B`, and `B` pointing back to `A`.

In pretty much every other case, it offers an elegant and very efficient way to cache data to PHP files, and a solid alternative to serialization.
